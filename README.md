# Predicing Diabetes Health Indicators using ML 

This repository contains code and resources for predicting the likelihood of diabetes onset using machine learning models. Diabetes is a chronic condition with significant health implications, and early detection plays a crucial role in the effective management and prevention of complications. By leveraging machine learning techniques on relevant datasets, we aim to develop predictive models to identify individuals at risk of diabetes. We are using data found on Kaggle called the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset with data collected from the CDC.

Using this dataset, we want to answer the following question:
Which model can most accurately determine the factors (top 3) that predict whether an individual has diabetes or not?

## Models utilized:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- LASSO Regression
- Best Subset Selection
- Forward Selection
- Principal Component Analysis
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Neural Network: Multi-Layer Perceptron

**For all models, an 80-20 train-test split.**
